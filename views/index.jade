    h3 What is Moodful?
    p Moodful is way for you to track and analyze your moods while using some basic mindfulness principles. Mindfulness means focusing your mind to be fully present and aware of where you are and what youâ€™re doing, without being overly reactive to what's going on around you.

    h3 Analyze your entries
    p In addition to displaying your log entries, Moodful provides a "mood cloud" and graph of your last 10 moods, and displays your last journal for personal reflection. Reviewing this information can further help you gain awareness of how you feel over time. How often do you feel like you do?
